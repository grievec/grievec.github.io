					<h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Resourceful Project Manager and IT Professional skilled in building relationships while maintaining schedules to maximize client satisfaction. Organized and detail oriented, routinely surpassing expectations, while crafting unique solutions for each new challenge.</p>
                    <p> I am currently a Department Secretary at Central Washington University, after being a full-time student. In this administravtive assistant role, I provide individualized attention to students, faculty, and staff. Listening to individuals, identifying issues, problem-solving options, offering services, utilizing my knowledge of University policy and procedure to assist others, and to resolve complaints and conflicts.</p> 
					<p>Before returning to school, I was employed full-time as Project Manager for a fast-paced web and app development agency based in Seattle, with all executives and team members working remotely from homes spread across the state and country.</p>
					<p>Working remotely helped refine strong professional written and verbal communication skills by interacting with clients both local and international, primarily through video conferencing, email, and telephone, as well as in-person client meetings. Ensuring all information received was entered and acted on appropriately.</p>
					<p>Additionally, I set-up and maintained our enterprise management software and integrations, and worked as an assistant developer on projects. I had the privilege of assisting clients with selecting the content management system and e-commerce platforms that would best fit their needs- then assisted with the set-up and maintenance of their sites and products.</p>
                    <p>While attending Central Washington University, I had the opportunity to work at Central Access as a Lead Alternative Media Tech and Tactile Specialist. Central Access processes textbooks to make them accessible in different formats like Braille, audio, and HTML. I specifically created tactile images (images you can touch) from textbook graphs, charts, etc. for blind and vision impaired individuals. This work with Central Access has allowed me to work with students and co-workers with a range of abilities and challenges, learning how to design for accessibility.</p>
